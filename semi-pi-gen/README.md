# semi-pi-gen

This directory tree contains a stripped-down fork of the
[pi-gen](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen) scripts used create bootable
Raspberry Pi OS images. This fork is customized for the `rc-stickynote`
project and is used to create an image that includes the stickynote software
and configuration files.

The files here were copied off of commit
f8f3d6fe93a6709f02f63f3a203a38bcd33a0c0d of the pi-gen repository, dated 2020
